            <p class="text">
                The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are an infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.
                <br> <br>
                The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.

                Alive due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big Mom's territory, his bounty condition was 
                reverted back to Dead or Alive, and its value increased to $330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, 
                his bounty was increased to $1,032,000,000.Despite renouncing his surname Vinsmoke, the World Government

                captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member

                He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford.

               Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to 
               prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited

               Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw

                Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at 
                $438,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to $1,100,000,000.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", is the founder and captain of the 
                increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.
                 He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,
                  which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers and crew.
                  He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.

                Luffy also has a penchant for attracting followers and has unwillingly been named the leader of the Straw Hat 
                Grand Fleet, consisting of seven pirate crews who swore to come to his aid whenever he wishes. After learning of 
                this and his exploits against the Big Mom Pirates, the press labeled him the "Fifth Emperor of the Sea," though 
                many prominent figures initially considered this to be exaggerated.[39] However, after defeating Kaidou during the 
                Raid on Onigashima, Luffy was officially declared as one of the Four Emperors by the World Government along with 
                Buggy, replacing Kaidou and Big Mom.
                <br> <br>
                 Luffy has made tremendous strides in his life of piracy, with his bounty heavily reflecting this fact.
                 He gained his first bounty of $30,000,000 for defeating the strongest pirate captains of the East Blue,
                  which then increased to $100,000,000 after defeating Crocodile in Arabasta. After his crew's invasion into 
                  and escape from Enies Lobby, his bounty was increased to $300,000,000. His sizeable bounty upon arriving at 
                  the Sabaody Archipelago caused Luffy, along with Zoro to be included among the eleven "Super Rookies," pirates who 
                  simultaneously reached the Red Line with bounties of over $100,000,000 shortly before the Summit War. He, 
                  the other ten Super Rookies, and Marshall D. Teach would go on to be referred to as the "Worst Generation.

                Two years after the war, with his bounty increased to $400,000,000, he entered the New World and began 
                challenging the Emperors and their allies directly, with his bounty going up to $500,000,000 after the 
                Dressrosa Arc, and later all the way to $1,500,000,000 after the global revelation that he is Sabo's brother 
                and the existence of Straw Hat Grand Fleet becoming public, as well as the events of the Whole Cake Island Arc. After 
                leading the Raid on Onigashima and defeating Kaidou, his bounty was increased to $3,000,000,000.
